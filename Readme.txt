Libft is a custom C library developed as part of the curriculum at the 42 School. It serves as an introduction to coding in C, where students create their own versions of essential standard library functions, as well as some additional utility functions.

The library is divided into several parts:

Libc Functions: These are fundamental functions like memset, strlen, strcpy, and others from the C standard library. Reimplementing these helps students understand memory manipulation, string handling, and basic C mechanics.
Additional Utility Functions: Functions that are commonly useful but not available in libc, such as ft_split (for splitting strings) and ft_itoa (for integer-to-string conversion).
Linked List Functions (Bonus): Basic linked list operations, which help students grasp data structures and pointer manipulation in C.
Libft is often used as a foundational library for future projects at 42, making it a valuable asset throughout the program.
