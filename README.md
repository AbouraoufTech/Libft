Libft is a foundational project at 42 School, where students build a custom library in C that mimics and extends the capabilities of the standard C library (libc). The primary goal of Libft is to deepen students' understanding of low-level programming concepts, including memory allocation, string manipulation, and data structures, while also reinforcing coding best practices.

Purpose of Libft
Libft helps students gain a strong grasp of:

Standard Library Functions: By recreating core functions like memcpy, strlen, and strdup, students learn how these functions work internally. This part of the project covers a wide range of operations on strings, memory, and files.

Additional Utility Functions: Libft goes beyond the standard library by introducing extra functions that are useful in many C projects but aren't part of libc. Examples include ft_split (for splitting strings based on delimiters), ft_itoa (to convert integers to strings), and ft_strtrim (to remove leading and trailing characters from strings). These functions enhance C's limited standard library and are useful building blocks in larger projects.

Data Structures with Linked Lists (Bonus): Students implement basic linked list operations, such as creating, adding, and deleting nodes. This section helps build familiarity with pointers and dynamic memory, critical skills for managing more complex data structures in future projects.

How Libft is Used
The library is designed as a reusable resource: once completed, Libft can be linked to future projects, providing a personal toolkit of reliable, tested functions that save time and simplify complex tasks. The process of creating Libft teaches essential programming concepts and builds confidence, preparing students for more advanced projects in the 42 curriculum.

Overall, Libft is a cornerstone project that not only reinforces C fundamentals but also establishes a strong foundation for low-level programming, memory management, and problem-solving, which are invaluable skills throughout a career in software development.
